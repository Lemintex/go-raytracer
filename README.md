# Go Raytracer
This is a Go project that generates photorealistic images by simulating lots of light rays and collating the results of these calculations into an image.

## Book 1
### Features
- Ray tracing system
- Simple camera
- Sphere collisions
- Antialiasing
- Materials
  - Lambertian
  - Metallic
  - Dielectric
- Advanced camera features
  - FOV
  - Positionable camera
  - Defocus blur (Depth of field)
### Result

## Book 2
### Featuress
- Motion blur
- Bounding voluume heirarchies
- Texture mapping
- Image mapping
- Perlin Noise
- Quadrilaterals
- Emmision-based lighting
### Result

#### Notes
This image doesn't contain any quadrilaterals as they were very hard to orient and place correctly. In fact, this has deterred me from continuing development on this project (I planned fog, triangles, cubes, translation, rotation, scale, and mesh rendering) as without a placement engine it really is a guessing game... perhaps in the future I will pick this back up. Although, I should make something other than rendering engines.

Also, 5000 rays per pixel for that second image took a while to render...
